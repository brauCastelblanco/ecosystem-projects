  "summary": "DeltaPrime aggregates the best of Avalanche in one DeFi ecosystem. Within this ecosystem, investors get access to extra capital, which can be borrowed and used in a completely trustless fashion. This way, they can multiply their returns, while keeping full control over the risk-reward ratio of their DeFi portfolio. The minimum collateral ratio is 20%, and borrowed funds are protected by the Dedicated Smart Contract, which protects and liquidates part of the borrowed funds if necessary.",
